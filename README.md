# Red Ball Identification and Tracking Project 🏀

## Project Tasks

Task 1: Image Processing

  📚 Import required Python libraries: OpenCV (cv2), numpy, and sys.
  🖼️ Load and verify the image (red_ball.jpg).
  🌈 Convert the image from RGB to HSV color space.
  🎨 Detect the red color in the image using binary operations.
  🧹 Improve image quality by removing noise with morphological operations.
  🎯 Identify the center of gravity of the red ball and mark it.
  🏷️ Add the label "red ball" near the center of gravity.

Task 2: Video Processing

  📹 Import the video (rgb_ball_720.mp4) and ensure correct import.
